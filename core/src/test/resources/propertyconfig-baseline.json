        "description": "Located in Midtown West, Manhattan, residents of The Eugene have a haven in the middle of one of the most dynamic cities in the world. Each penthouse apartment boasts floor-to-ceiling views of New York’s iconic skyline. An NBA-size basketball court, climbing wall, yoga room, and game room are just a few of many ways to unwind without putting on a coat. There’s a library lounge ideal for distraction-free reading or working. There’s even a rooftop club sixty-two stories above the city complete with a sunroom, bar, and outdoor grilling stations. Pets get love, too, thanks to an on-site grooming station. And when residents want to explore, there are dining and shopping options, galore at nearby Hudson Yards. ",
